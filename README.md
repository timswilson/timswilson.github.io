## Quick Start (Running Locally)
http://localhost:4000/

```bash
bundle install                    # first time only, installs dependencies
bundle exec jekyll serve          # starts local server at http://localhost:4000/
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch  # same as above, but auto-reloads on file changes
```
> **Note:** Changes to `_config.yml` require you to restart the server.

## Files You Should NOT Touch

| Folder / File | Why |
|---|---|
| `_site/` | Auto-generated by Jekyll on build. Never edit directly — your changes will be overwritten. |
| `_sass/bootstrap/` | Bootstrap source SCSS. Override via `_variables.scss` instead. |
| `Gemfile.lock` | Auto-generated dependency versions. Only changes when you run `bundle install`. |
| `.gitignore` | Already configured, no reason to change. |

## Where to Update Things

### Header / Navigation
**File:** `_includes/header.html`  
Contains the fixed top nav bar (logo + About/Contact links). Update nav link text or add new links here.

### Footer
**File:** `_includes/footer.html`  
Contains the copyright line and any footer links. Update the year and location here.

### Homepage Content
**File:** `index.html`  
This is the main page — hero section, about section, contact section, etc. All of the visible page content lives here.

### TypeIt Animation
**File:** `assets/js/typeIt.js` 
The typing animation on the homepage. Update the `.type()` chains to change what gets typed. See https://typeitjs.com for API docs.

### Page Layout / Structure
**File:** `_layouts/default.html`  
The shell that wraps every page — `<html>`, `<head>`, includes for header/footer, and the `{{ content }}` tag where page content gets injected. You rarely need to touch this unless you're adding a new script or stylesheet globally.

### Site-Wide Config
**File:** `_config.yml`  
Site title, description, URL, and other Jekyll settings. Update this if you change your domain, site title, or social links.

### Head / Meta Tags / Fonts
**File:** `_includes/head.html`  
Everything inside `<head>` — meta tags, font imports (Inter from Google Fonts), CSS links. Add new stylesheets or change the page title format here.

### Styles
**File:** `assets/css/style.scss`  
Your main stylesheet. Custom CSS goes here (nav styles, section styles, etc.).  
**File:** `_sass/_variables.scss`  
Bootstrap variable overrides — colors, fonts, spacing. Change the site's color palette here.

> **The right way to style:** Override Bootstrap variables in `_variables.scss` first. Only write custom CSS in `style.scss` if Bootstrap doesn't have a variable for it.

### Images
**Folder:** `assets/img/`  
Headshot, family photos, logos, etc. Reference them in HTML as `/assets/img/your-file.jpg`.

### Favicon
**File:** `favicon.ico` (root directory)

---

## Common Tasks

### "I want to add a new section to the homepage"
Add the HTML to `index.html`. Follow the pattern of existing sections (section tag + section-label + divider + content). Add any new styles to `style.scss`.

### "I want to change colors or fonts"
Update `_sass/_variables.scss` for Bootstrap-level changes. For custom component colors (like the nav), update `assets/css/style.scss`.

### "I want to add a new page (e.g. /resume/)"
Create a new file like `resume.html` in the root with Jekyll front matter at the top:
```yaml
---
layout: default
title: Resume
---
```
Then add a link to it in `_includes/header.html`.

---

## Deployment

Just push to `master`. GitHub Pages auto-builds and deploys. Changes typically go live within a minute or two.

---

## Jekyll Reminders

- `_site/` is generated automatically on build — don't edit it
- Files/folders starting with `_` are processed by Jekyll but not output directly
- Front matter (the `---` block at the top of files) is required for Jekyll to process a file
- Liquid templating: `{{ variable }}` outputs a value, `{% include file.html %}` pulls in a partial

---



## Notes on Jekyll

- \_site is generated automatically, don't touch it
- To run Jekyll locally run bundle exec jekyll serve from the top level folder
  - bundle exec jekyll serve --watch will run Jekyll and have it auto reconfigure upon save of a file.

# Jekyll/Bootstrap

[Jekyll/Bootstrap GitHub](https://github.com/robertlove/jekyll-bootstrap)

Jekyll/Bootstrap is a Jekyll starter project for GitHub Pages with Bootstrap baked right in.

Jekyll/Bootstrap solves the confusing task of integrating Bootstrap with Jekyll by doing the integration for you - _the right way_ - then guiding you through the simple process of customising Bootstrap - _the right way_.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static website generator that works seamlessly with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Whilst [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is the world's most popular front-end component library. Put this all together and you get a fast, secure and highly customisable static website with free hosting.

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you've installed [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Then:

1. `$ git clone https://github.com/robertlove/jekyll-bootstrap.git`
1. `$ cd jekyll-bootstrap`
1. `$ bundle install`
1. `$ bundle exec jekyll serve`

If all went well, you'll be able to view your new Jekyll/Bootstrap website locally by going to http://127.0.0.1:4000/jekyll-bootstrap/ in your browser.

## Usage

### Configuration

- Open [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) and update the following configuration options:
  - `title`
  - `description`
  - `baseurl`
  - `url`
  - `twitter`
- Replace `/favicon.ico` with your own favicon
- Replace `/assets/img/image.jpg` with your own image

**Note:** Changes to `_config.yml` require you to rerun `$ bundle exec jekyll serve` in order for the changes to take effect.

For a full list of configuration options, see [Jekyll Configuration](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/).

### Customising Bootstrap

One of the biggest criticisms of Bootstrap is that it makes your website look like every other Bootstrap website out there. This criticism is borne out of ignorance. Used properly, you'll be able to customise Bootstrap to make even the pickiest designer proud of you.

The process is:

1. Use Bootstrap components and classes in your HTML - there are many (and many utility classes are undocumented)
1. Override Bootstrap's default variables in [`_sass/_variables.scss`](_sass/_variables.scss)
1. Write custom styles in [`assets/css/style.css`](assets/css/style.scss)
1. Write custom scripts in [`assets/js/script.js`](assets/js/script.js)

For a full list of classes - including the undocumented ones, see [Bootstrap CSS](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/dist/css/bootstrap.css)

For a full list of variables, see [Bootstrap SCSS Variables](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/scss/_variables.scss).

**Note:** Done correctly, you'll likely never get to steps 3 and 4. If you do, before continuing, have another think about the way you're architecting your front-end.

### Icons

Jekyll/Bootstrap comes with [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) pre-installed. Use the icon include for all your icon needs. The `name` parameter is used to specify the icon and is required. The `class` parameter is used to add any additional classes for styling and is optional.

```
{% include icon.html name='github' class='text-danger' %}
```

### Using Third-party Libraries

Sometimes you'll want to use third-party libraries to achieve the results you're after. For example, you might want to use [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) for syntax highlighting or [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) for displaying dates and times in JavaScript.

To use a third-party library:

#### Styles

1. Copy any `*.css` or `*.scss` files to the [`_sass`](_sass) folder
1. Rename any `*.css` files to `*.scss` (e.g. rename `prism.css` to `prism.scss`)
1. Open [`assets/css/style.css`](assets/css/style.scss) and import your SCSS file(s) (e.g. `@import "path/to/prism";` - leaving out the `.scss` file extension)

This will compile and minify all styles into `_site/assets/css/style.css`.

#### Scripts

1. Copy any `*.js` files to the [`assets/js`](assets/js) folder
1. Open [`assets/js/script.js`](assets/js/script.js) and import your JavaScript file(s) (e.g. `{% include_relative path/to/prism.js %}`)
1. Open [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) and add your JavaScript file(s) to the list of excludes under `exclude:` (e.g. ` - assets/js/path/to/prism.js`)

This will compile (but not minify) all scripts into `_site/assets/js/script.js`. Jekyll doesn't support minification of JavaScript files on GitHub Pages. If you want your scripts to be minified, use the minified versions supplied by the third-party library.
